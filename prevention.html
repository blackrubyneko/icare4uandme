                    <h2><a id="#immunise" name="#immunise"></a>"Immunise against infectious diseases"</h2>
                        
                    <p>Immunisation is a way of preventing infectious diseases. Immunisations are offered to babies, children, adults and elders to protect against serious and preventable diseases.</p>
                        
                    <h3>Influenza – the flu</h3>
                        
                    <p>Influenza is a serious disease that can cause severe illness in some people – it is worse than a cold. Influenza spreads quickly from person to person through touch as well as through the air.</p>

                    <p>Immunisation is your best defence against influenza. Influenza viruses change from year-to-year, so the seasonal influenza vaccine is made especially each year to cover the strains of the virus most likely to be circulating the following winter.</p>

                    <p>Because of this, it is important to have an influenza vaccination each year – it is available from mid to late March until 31 December – but it is recommended before winter.</p>

                    <p>For pregnant women, those aged 65 years and over and those with certain medical conditions, the vaccine is free. Talk to your doctor or nurse to see if you are eligible for a funded influenza vaccine. Some workplaces may also provide influenza vaccinations for staff.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Wash your hands well</h2>
                    
                    <h5>How to wash</h5>
                    <p>Washing hands properly is one of the most important and effective ways of stopping the spread of infections and illnesses.</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wash your hands thoroughly using water and plain soap.</li>
                        <li>Wash for at least 20 seconds and dry them completely.</li>
                        <li>Using warm water is preferable, if available.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>If soap and water are not available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <h5>When to wash</h5>
                    <p>Always wash and dry your hands:</p>
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li>Before eating or preparing food</li>
                            <li>After;</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>sneezing, coughing or blowing your nose (or wiping children’s or other people’s noses)</li>
                                <li>gardening or outside activities</li>
                                <li>having contact with animals</li>
                                <li>using the toilet or changing nappies</li>
                                <li>looking after sick people.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </ul>
                    <br/>
                    <h2>Stay at home if you're sick</h2>
                    <p>It's important that if you're unwell you stay at home to stop the spread of the infection to others.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Keep your distance (at least 1 metre away) from other members of your household to stop them from getting ill as well.</p>
                    <br/>
                    
                    <h2>Cover coughs and sneezes</h2>
                    <p>Some infectious diseases can be transferred in the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Examples include influenza, measles and chicken pox.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>If you are unwell, avoid close contact with other people. Cover your coughs and sneezes to stop spreading the illness to other people.</p>
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze – then put the tissue in a bin.</li>
                            <li>If you do not have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your elbow.</li>
                            <li>Clean your hands after you cover a cough or sneeze.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <br/>
                    <h2>Keep household surfaces clean</h2>
                    <p>Some infectious diseases can be spread by touching a surface or object that has been contaminated by an infected person.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Regularly cleaning household surfaces that are frequently touched will help reduce the spread of infections. Some examples of frequently used surfaces include tables, bench tops, door handles, light switches, toys and taps.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Clean surfaces with hot soapy water or your normal household cleaning product. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions on correct product use.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Where possible, use disposable cloths or paper towels to clean surfaces. Reusable cloths should be disinfected and then dried after use, as bacteria and viruses can still survive on damp cloths.</p>
                    <br/>
                    
                    <h2>Ventilate your home</h2>
                    <p>Poor ventilation in rooms can increase the spread of infectious diseases. Open windows regularly to get fresh air circulating.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>If you have air conditioning or a heat pump, make sure the system is maintained and the filters cleaned.</p>

hi

friends it's me amber the sister of dr

skittles

well dr skittles is not here because

i was quarantined so he is not with me

today

i will tell you what happened it was

last month

when i developed the following symptoms

my family quarantined me in one of our

rooms

as per the instruction of our doctor

well it got worse that's why my parents

decided to bring me to the nearest

hospital

the hospital staffs were notified early

about my symptoms

that is why when i met them they were

wearing a full personal protective

equipment

and advised my parents to also

quarantine at home

i was put at a quarantine facility i was

so scared since i was left alone

i have no one to talk to during that

time the doctor says i need to rest

well the doctor confirmed that i

acquired coronavirus

the reason why we are at home and can't

go out right now

what did i do while i got it you asked

you see months before i got sick my

friends and i decided to go out and meet

it's been months since we last see each

other honestly

if i know that i will get sick because

of that i will not go out anymore

we met at the one of our friend's house

we had a small party

just for all of us and because it's a

party

we didn't wear face mask or anything

that could prevent us from getting the

virus

little did we know that one of our

friends is sick during that time

that friend didn't say anything to us so

we still continue to party like

everything's okay

and there a few days after that party i

developed symptoms of coronavirus

it is scary just like what they told us

in the news

luckily few weeks after my first symptom

i got better and the doctor told me that

i am free from the virus but still

i need to quarantine myself to be sure

why did i share my story you asked

well it is related to our lesson for

today

let me introduce to you the concept of

communicable disease

communicable disease is a disease that

can be transmuted or spread

from one person to another or animal to

another

it is also called an infectious disease

that ranges from athlete's food

and chickenpox to severe cases

like coronavirus a communicable disease

is caused by pathogens or disease

agents that enter the body through their

record in direct contact

the following are the common pathogens

pharos

bacteria fungi and parasite

let's learn the difference of them

viruses are very tiny organisms smaller

than bacteria

they cause diseases not only to humans

but also to animals and plants virus

needs a living host

they cannot grow or breed if they are

not inside a living cell

when they are in a human cell they

increase fats and cause diseases

next is bacteria bacteria are very tiny

single cell living things that are found

almost everywhere

they can be seen under a microscope some

bacteria are dangerous because they

cause diseases

other bacteria may be useful they can

help in making things rot and in

fermentation

next is fungi fungi are living things

that are not

animals or plants they are almost

everywhere

they may even grow on human skin these

include

yeast and molds as well as the mushrooms

last is parasite parasites are organisms

that live in another organism called a

host

parasites are living things that get

their food from other living things

there are parasites that are big enough

to be seen by the naked eye

did you know that these pathogens are

only part of the factors of a

communicable disease

to understand further communicable

diseases

you need to learn the elements of the

chain of infection

from pathogen to susceptible host

but i don't want to spoil you because dr

skittles told me

that he will discuss it to you next week

expect that by next week

you will learn the following elements of

chain of infection

transmission of communicable disease

that's all for today

and i want you to stay safe stay home

and stay healthy see ya
